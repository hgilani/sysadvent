# Day 22 - Be a Fire Marshal, Not a Fire Fighter

This was written by [Kate Matsudaira](https://twitter.com/katemats).

It’s the end of the year, time for contemplation ... and resolutions.  As you
think back on this year, were you a Fire Marshal or a Fire Fighter?

Being a fire fighter can seem rewarding; they swoop in save the day and play
the hero.  However, in a highly effective team there should be no heroes.   The
recognition that comes with saving the day often outweighs the silence that
comes from a smooth, seamless deployment or issues resolved without customer
impact.

The thing about operations and infrastructure teams is that a lot of the work
isn’t noticeable unless it is done wrong.  Executives pay attention and take
notice when things go awry or problems, like outages, occur.  Great work,
streamlined processes, and reduced costs are sometimes harder to see.  

Far too often, operations and devops teams enter into a death spiral of
reactivity - a positive feedback loop without preventive planning.  These teams
fail to allocate time to proactive measures, which, in turn, leads to crisis
after crisis.  How does such a team, otherwise beaten down and demoralized by
operational problems, find a way to reboot into a "proactive" state of being?

Whether you are a team member or the team manager, you can help pull your team
of fighters into a more organized brigade setup to put fires out before they
become a problem. 

When it comes to fire fighting, there are typically two things at play: the way
we select problems to solve, and how we solve them.

## Selecting Problems

* Reactive teams work on every problem that comes up.
* The project in progress is always the one with the most urgent deadline.
* The priority of the problem is often dictated by the originator of the
  request, instead of the business need.

## Solving Problems

* Reactive teams give all problems to the fastest resolver, regardless of past
  or current assignments.
* There are often lots of inefficiencies – too many people in meetings or
  involved in resolving incidents. 
* Since everything is urgent, there isn’t enough focus on the root causes;
  resulting in lots of patches and hacks.

In order to move from being fire fighter to a fire marshal, it is important to
devise a strategy that will address both.  Here are some suggestions and
recommendations to get you started:

* All equipment should be operable by multiple people. You wouldn’t want a fire
  department with one only person who could operate the truck. The same goes
  for software.  Are there any systems or tools that only one person knows how to
  debug or diagnose?  Inevitably, these single points of failure can result
  in fire drills and can cause inefficiencies.  Taking the time to train
  multiple people on each part of the system will create redundancy and improve
  overall team knowledge of operations, and invariably, it creates
  opportunities through previously unnoticed synergies.
* Plan to plan.  It is easy to get caught up into what is urgent and tactical,
  but proactive planning won’t happen without explicitly creating time for it.
  Moreover, periodically moving players between the duties of ops tactics and
  strategy planning helps balance the load and can provide an often much needed
  break from the line of fire. Draw a clear "line in the sand" between the
  strategy and operations; build a firewall, but fairly, so as to not prevent
  progress.
* Put players on assignments that play to their strengths. It is true that
  learning new things and pushing people to challenge themselves is wise when it
  comes to long term career development.  However, in a team that is more
  reactive and constantly dealing with issues, it may be best to give each person
  an assignment they will be able to knock out of the park.  By giving people the
  work that they are best at, they can complete it quickly and hopefully have
  extra cycles to help with more proactive preventive assignments.  Moreover, if
  there are players on your team with a higher tolerance to crisis, setup roles
  that align players with their tolerance level. Some people thrive on the
  reactivity, and can play the role of your "trauma surgeons," so to speak.
* Focus on root cause.  When there is a crisis it is important to focus on what
  will stop the damage, and get the systems back up and operating normally.  And
  in reactive situations once things are stabilized a complete diagnosis can be
  put on the backburner with the temporary solution put together on gut feeling.
  Resulting in more brittle and unstable software.  By helping create a culture
  of understanding and training other problem solvers people are able to take on
  more responsibility and solve problems properly.
* Show signs of real change. If you are adopting a new paradigm or cultural
  shift, aim for shock-and-awe: do something remarkable to demonstrate that you
  are breaking the cycle of reactivity (e.g. take the most legacy
  behavior/process and either eradicate it or drastically modify it). It is
  usually pretty obvious when a team is under water from incidents, but it can be
  hard to see what has been postponed in lieu of all these urgent problems. What
  are the important items that need to be tackled? Make a list or add them to
  your backlog; simply cataloging this work will provide visibility and then
  progress.
* Let go of the "unhappy's". Both figuratively and literally.  Very seldom is
  change welcomed with open arms, especially among us engineers who tend to like
  patterns and routine. Try to enlist help at the top from your manager or other
  senior team members.  Expect to be met with some resistance, and when it
  happens, ask questions and try to understand their concerns; you may be surprised
  by some good insights and ideas.  Be bold; come with a plan and enact
  quickly. Show confidence but flexibility and willingness to listen.
* Create a positive feedback cycle.  A key part of any change is to show
  progress and small victories. Signify progress by planning an off-site or
  organizing team building exercises that otherwise would've been impossible due
  to constant fire-fighting.  Leverage metrics like constant trend analysis
  reporting with statistically useful "human" measures that show progress and
  improvements.  Just don't reward people just for making more work for
  themselves. That's like rewarding professional fire fighters for acts of arson!
  Further, it sends a wrong message about the kind of work behavior that is
  valued.

Some of these suggestions are easier to execute in a leadership role, but
it doesn’t matter what your level or job is. Taking time to step back and think
about proactively addressing issues before they arise is a great way to improve
your work for you and your teammates. Bonus, that in many cases can also lead
to upward advancement and promotions.

Leadership is about influence, and management is about authority; and most of
these suggestions can be achieved without any formal authority.  Although I
would still recommend getting your manager or team lead aligned with your
mission – it will make it even easier to have a strong ally.

And remember, you're training a team of Fire Marshals, not Fire Fighters.
Firefighting is an ephemeral state. Instead, a constant state of vigilance and
fire prevention is what you want to engender.
