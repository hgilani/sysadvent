# Day 2 - Building Community for Fun and Profit

> Community usually refers to a village that shares common
values. In human communities, intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs,
risks, and a number of other conditions may be present and common, affecting
the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.

> Since the advent of the Internet, the concept of community has less
geographical limitation, as people can now gather virtually in an online
community and share common interests regardless of physical location. Prior to
the internet, virtual communities (like social or academic organizations) were
far more limited by the constraints of available communication and
transportation technologies.

What community means to me
--------------------------

Community has always been a critical part of my life long obsession with
computers and the Internet. At every stage it was some community that took me a
new level of my computer usage, starting with BBSes and gaming clubs, through
the community around the [Englightenment](http://www.englightenment.org),
particularly its irc channel __#e__ (now on [Freenode](http://freenode.net)),
and the online open source community, that at the time revolved around
[Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org), [Freshmeat](http://www.fresmeant.net), and
[Themes.org](http://www.themes.org). All of which I got involved in back in
High School. It was through these sites and the __#e__ irc channel that I
encountered people who got __paid!__ to manage Linux boxes all day. I knew
immediately that this is what I wanted to do for a living to. I loved Linux, I
loved building servers at home, and my path was set.

Along the way I've become involved in many communities around varies open
source distributions, languages, particularly libraries or web frameworks,
commercial technologies, and geographic location, and through these I've grown
as a technologist, as a professional, and as a person. I've made many long
lasting friendship and gotten my last three jobs.

I suspect most, if not all, of you are having a _me too_ moment in reading the
above, because community is a big part of both our world of technology and the
world at large. I consider it a critical piece of being an Operations
professional to be involved in some kind of Ops or Technology community and I
hope to provide some examples of communities you can join or help build as I
discuss what I've learned about building community over my last 14 years of
being involved in open source and ops/sysadmin communities.

dat devops
----------

I've the had the privilege of becoming part of the DevOps community over the
last two years, including helping organize and speak at last year's [Devops
Days](http://www.devopsday.org) Mountain View conference. Infiltration and
overuse of the term by marketing departments aside, the Devops community to me
is a perfect example of how a great community is built. The community has grown
organically over the last two-three years because people around the world found
common ground in a topic and wanted the opportunity to discuss, evolve, and
share that topic.

Some of the key things the Devops community has done are

* create free or very cheap conferences at numerous locations around the world
 * see who people in the community enjoy hearing from and bringing those people
   into to talk
* created google groups for discussion
* created irc channels for discussion
* accepted that marketing and sales will become a part of any vibrant community
* encouraged civil discourse and respect (adamhjk's no asshole rules)
* inclusive by default, encourage "noobs" with passion to step and up and be a part
* "lead the herd" by speaking, blogging, tweeting, ircing, posting to newsgroups
* busted ass to create real change for the topic at hand, not worrying about fame or fortune

hangops history lesson
----------------------

In the past three months I've been lucky enough to work with [Jordan
Sissel](http://www.twitter.com/jordansissel) in building a new community,
hangops.com.

Hangops started as an idea I had one day and proposed to Jordan, that he and I
do a weekly Google Hangout to have coffee _virtually_ and shoot the shit, which
I had in reaction to having been working from home for six months and starting
to miss the socialization of being in an office a litle. He liked the idea and
said "why not make it public?" I could see no reason not to, and following the
recent Twitter trend of __#hugops__ and __#dadops__ we thought using the
hashtag __#hangops__ would be a fun moniker, since the idea is to enable remote
Ops folks (dev, qa, security, etc are welcome too!) to _hang out_ via a Google
Hangout and shoot the shit.

So we decided on a day/time and did a couple [tweets](link to original tweet)
about it. We had a good turn out for the first one, so we decided to do it
every week. A couple more weeks of good responses and we decided to get
official. I registered hangops.com, put up a small static site, registered
[@hangops](http://www.twitter.com), and we started using Google Hangout's [On
Air](link plz) feature to live stream the sessions, and record them for people
that can't make a session. I put the hangops.com site up as a repo on Github
and encouraged people to mention topic ideas by making [issues](issue link)
against the repo, which also got a nice response. And we started an irc
channel, _#hangops_ on Freenode.

We had a great response to these things and in the last month I've started
getting specific people from the greater (dev)Ops community to be special
guests as we discuss topics like [Puppetconf/Surgecon recap](recap vid),
[AWS](aws vid), [Sensu](sensu vid), [Career Paths and hiring](career vid), and
an upcoming session on [#monitoringlove](link to tweet)

I've gotten an amazing response from people in the community and coworkers at
Mozilla from hangops, people love the style of the sessions, the material, and
keep asking for more. We even saw a __live hangops__ at [Puppetconf](link to
tweet or gist).

In reflecting on the growth of the hangops community over the last three or so
months, I think the key things were

* lots of ops people work from home, like to socialize
* lots of ops people like to hear people they consider smart talk about things
  they are interested in
* I had fun with it
* I was willing to invest time and money into it, with no guarantee it would be
  more than jordan and myself describing cat gifs every week
* I've worked hard to make it an open community and encourage people to join
  the hangout even if they're unsure what they may add
* I've made the format a mix of roundtable and topical discussions
* encouraging feedback whenever possible

Things I am looking for the future are:

* a better site
* a google calendar
* making a podcast mp3 feed and a video feed
* show notes?
* transcription?
* a proper logo? 

In conclusion
-------------

I think the key to building a community is a mix of passion and fearlessness.
You have to really be invested in the idea of the community you want to help
build, but you also have to be willing to fail.

Things like Twitter, Google Hangouts, IRC channels, and a fun hash tag make it
really easy to organically grow and promote a new community as well. 

If you're someone looking for a community about ops and sysadmin things, I'd
love to see you join the #hangops community and if you're someone trying to
build your own community I hope this article has given you some ideas and
hopefully some motivation for your own endevour.
