# Day 2 - Building Community for Fun and Profit

This was written by [Brandon Burton](http://twitter.com/solarce).

> Community usually refers to a village that shares common
values. In human communities, intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs,
risks, and a number of other conditions may be present and common, affecting
the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.

> Since the advent of the Internet, the concept of community has less
geographical limitation, as people can now gather virtually in an online
community and share common interests regardless of physical location. Prior to
the internet, virtual communities (like social or academic organizations) were
far more limited by the constraints of available communication and
transportation technologies.

what community means to me
--------------------------

Community has always been a critical part of my life-long obsession with
computers and the Internet. It was always a community that took me a new level
of my computer usage, starting with BBSes and gaming clubs, then the
[Englightenment](http://enlightenment.org/) project, particularly its IRC
channel, __#e__ (now on [Freenode](http://freenode.net)), and ultimately,
online open source community as a whole, which then revolved around
[Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org), [Freshmeat](http://www.fresmeant.net), and
[Themes.org](http://www.themes.org). I got involved in all of these back
in high school. It was through these sites and the __#e__ irc channel that I
encountered people who got __paid!__ to manage Linux boxes all day. I knew
immediately that this is what I wanted to do for a living to. I loved Linux. I
loved building servers at home. My path was set.

Along the way, I've become involved in many communities around various open
source projects, particularly libraries or web frameworks, commercial
technologies, and geographic location, and through these, I've grown as a
technologist, as a professional, and as a person. I've made many long
lasting friendship and community relationships are responsible for my last
three jobs.

I suspect most, if not all, of you are having a _me too_ moment in reading
this, because community is a big part of both our world of technology and the
world at large. Community involvement is a critical piece of being an
Operations professional, and I hope to provide some examples of communities you
can join or help build as I discuss what I've learned about building community
over my last 14 years of being involved in open source and ops/sysadmin
communities.

dat devops
----------

I've the had the privilege of becoming part of the DevOps community over the
last two years, including helping organize and speak at last year's [devops
days](http://www.devopsday.org) Mountain View conference. The DevOps community
to me is a perfect example of how a great community is built. It has grown
organically over the last three years because people around the world found
common ground in a topic and wanted the opportunity to discuss, evolve, and
share that topic.

Some of the key things the DevOps community has done are

* create free or very cheap conferences at numerous locations around the world
* created google groups for discussion
* created irc channels for discussion
* accepted that marketing and sales will become a part of any vibrant community
* encouraged civil discourse and respect (see ["the No Asshole rule"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No_Asshole_Rule))
* inclusive by default, encourage "noobs" with passion to step and up and be a part
* "lead the herd" by speaking, blogging, tweeting, ircing, posting to newsgroups
* busted ass to create real change for the topic at hand, not worrying about fame or fortune

hangops history lesson
----------------------

In the past three months I've been lucky enough to work with [Jordan
Sissel](http://www.twitter.com/jordansissel) in building a new community:
[hangops.com](http://hangops.com).

Hangops started as an idea I had one day and proposed to Jordan, that he and I
do a weekly Google Hangout to have coffee _virtually_ and shoot the shit.
I had been working from home for six months and was starting to miss the
socialization of being in an office. He liked the idea and said "why not make
it public?" I could see no reason not to, and following the recent Twitter
trend of __[#hugops](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23hugops)__ and __[#dadops](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23dadops)__, we thought using the hashtag __[#hangops](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23hangops)__
would be a fun moniker, since the idea is to enable remote Ops folks (dev, qa,
security, etc are welcome too!) to _hang out_ via a Google Hangout and shoot
the shit.

So we decided on a day/time and did a couple tweets about it. We had a good
turn out for the first one and decided to make it a weekly event. After a
few weeks of good times and we decided to get official. I registered
hangops.com, put up a small static site, registered
[@hangops](http://www.twitter.com), and we started using Google Hangout's [On
Air](http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html) feature to live
stream the sessions, and record them for people that can't make a session. I
put the hangops.com site up as a repo on Github and encouraged people to
mention topic ideas by making [issues](issue link) against the repo, which also
got a nice response. And we started an irc channel, _#hangops_ on Freenode.

We had a great response to these things and in the last month I've started
getting specific people from the greater (dev)Ops community to be special
guests as we discuss topics like [Puppetconf/Surgecon
recap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLAH-Z4Ai3I&feature=plcp),
[AWS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvhcAKDXbm4),
[Sensu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJGQSXZrxeY), 
[Career Paths and hiring](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovf2Mk_K-q4), and
an upcoming session on
[#monitoringlove](https://twitter.com/hangops/status/271118704631226368).

There has been an amazing response about hangops. Folks love the style of the
sessions and the material, and they keep asking for more. We even saw a __live
hangops__ at Puppetconf.

Reflecting on the growth of the hangops community, I think the key things were:

* Ops people who work from home aldo like to socialize
* Ops people like to hear from smart and experience folks on interesting topics
* I had fun with it
* I was willing to invest time and money into it, with no guarantee it would be
  more than Jordan and myself sharing [cat gifs](http://i.imgur.com/VAXju.gif)
  every week.
* I've worked hard to make it an open community and encourage people to join
  the hangout even if they're unsure what they may add
* I've made the format a mix of roundtable and topical discussions
* encouraging feedback whenever possible

Things I am looking for the future are:

* a better site
* a google calendar
* making a podcast mp3 feed and a video feed
* show notes
* transcription
* a proper logo 

Conclusion
-------------

The key to building a community is a mix of passion and fearlessness. You have
to really be invested in the idea of the community you want to help build, but
you also have to [be willing to fail](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22willing%20to%20fail%22).

You have a huge array of communication tools available today; Things like
Twitter, Google Hangouts, IRC channels, and a fun hash tag make it
really easy to organically grow and promote a new community as well. 

If you're someone looking for a community about ops and sysadmin things, I'd
love to see you join the [#hangops](http://hangops.com) community, and if
you're someone trying to build your own community, I hope this article has
given you some ideas and hopefully some motivation for your own endevour.
