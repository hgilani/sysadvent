If you ask [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management),
"Configuration management (CM) is a field of management that focuses on
establishing and maintaining consistency of a system."

Configuration management tools increase sysadmin efficiency and make sysadmin
life better. As our systems grow larger and more complex, we need better tools
to help us increase control and reliability of ever growing quanities and
complexities in computing. Examples of such tools include Bcfg2, Cfengine,
Chef, and Puppet - all of which are open source!

Configuring systems manually in interactive sessions is error-prone and
extremely labor-intensive. Even with mostly-automated scripts, such as the
typical "ssh and a for-loop" solution, pushing ad-hoc changes are still error
prone. For example, if a system is down for maintenance while a change is
being pushed out over ssh, it will miss that change, and "state drift" will
occur between it and other systems in the same class.

You want a tool that helps keep actual and desired state the same.

System imaging is a common strategy for dealing with complexities of config
management - make a copy of a system image, label it "gold master", and clone
it to make new systems. While this approach helps to crank out identically
configured systems, it has the weakness that updating the master image can be a
pain and it does nothing to maintain the systems configured after the initial
deploy.  It is also not very auditable (what changed between golden image v1
and v2?).

Many sysadmins still configure systems with more traditional manual, ad-hoc,
and hard-to-audit methods. In some cases, sysadmin teams build home-grown
tools to solve these problems. An example of this is
[Ticketmaster](http://code.ticketmaster.com/), who released their own config
management, "ssh and for loop" tool, and provisioning systems.

Why do we care to do this? Well, why do we administer systems? Correct
configuration helps keep computer systems *in use by human civilization*.

CM tools free sysadmin's time for more challenging and creative system
engineering and architecture work and for taking naps which power such work.

## Minimize Manual Effort

Minimize manual effort by automatically configuring new systems. This works
well because repeatable work is best left to computers; they don't get bored,
and they don't forget steps.

["Go away or I will replace you with a very small shell
script"](http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/frustrations/374d/) -
you've probably seen this shirt before, right? How about hearing someone
recommend ["automating yourself out of a
job"](https://www.google.com/search?q=automate+yourself+out+of+a+job)?
Building systems and fighting fires without any tools is a slow task that is
difficult to repeat accurately, and with many sysadmin skills being
software-related, it is in your interest to automate system turn up,
maintenance, and repair. Automation helps reduce time spent in corrective
actions, reduces mental energy consumed, reduces stress, and increases
business value and agility. Winning!

In using a config management system, you are implicitly documenting the
system's "desired state" - Why is the system configured this way?
What are its dependencies? Who cares about the system?
This documenting capability helps protect against knowledge loss by moving
configuration knowledge out your brains and into a version control system.
This helps defend against data lost through forgetfulness or staff changes, and
it also facilitates alignment of efforts on a multi-sysadmin team. 

In general, configuration management is in the realm of ["Infrastructure as
Code"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKENuz-DKTg). Once your infrastructure
is represented in code, you can think about apply release engineering and other
tools - tag a new policy as "unstable", test it, then move the new policy into
the "stable" branch where servers will apply it.

## Getting Started

To encourage sysadmins to start using Configuration Management, the following
is a rough manual of how to do some small tasks in a few different, open source
configuration management tools demonstratiing what policies look like in common
open-source server.  Bourne shell examples are provided to help aid in
understanding.

## Using these examples

* Bourne shell:
    Can be run on the command line or via cron
* CFengine:
    Follow the [quick start guide](http://cfengine.com/manuals/cf3-quickstart.html)
    In a nutshell, put into a promise bundle inside a policy file (example.cf)
    and run from the command line with "cf-agent -f example.cf -b $bundlename";
    or integrate into the default policy set in promises.cf in the CFEngine
    work directory, often found in `/var/cfengine/inputs`.
* Chef:
    Follow the [Chef Fast Start
    guide](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Fast+Start+Guide)
* Puppet:
    Follow the [Getting Started guide](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/learning/).
    For quick testing of these examples, you can write them to a file 'foo.pp'
    and execute them with `puppet apply foo.pp`. Puppet also supports a
    client-server model that is more common for production deployments.

## Set Permissions on a File

* Bourne shell

        chmod 600 /tmp/testfile

* CFengine

        files:
            "/tmp/testfile"
                 perms   => m("600");

* Chef

        file "/tmp/testfile" do
          mode "0600"          
        end                  

* Puppet

        file { "/tmp/testfile":
           mode => 0600;
        }

## Create with some content

* Bourne shell

        echo 'Server will be down for maintenance 2 AM - 4 AM' > /etc/nologin

* CFengine

        files:
           "/etc/nologin"
                create     => "true",
                edit_line  =>  insert_lines("Server will be down for maintenance 2 AM - 4 AM");

* Chef

        file "/etc/nologin" do
          content 'Server will be down for maintenance 2 AM - 4 AM' 
        end 

* Puppet

        file { "/etc/nologin":
          ensure => present,
          content => "Server will be down for maintenance 2 AM - 4 AM";
        }

## Install a package

* Bourne shell

        yum -y install httpd

* CFengine

        packages:  
            "httpd"
                package_policy => "add",
                package_method => yum;

* Chef

        package "httpd" 

* Puppet

        package { "httpd":
          ensure => present;
        }
  
## Make sure a service daemon is running

* Bourne shell

        ps -ef | grep httpd >/dev/null 

        if [ $? -ne 0 ]  
          then /etc/init.d/httpd start 
        fi                            

* CFengine

        processes:
           "httpd"
                restart_class => "restart_httpd";

        commands:
         restart_httpd::
           "/etc/init.d/httpd start";

* Chef

        service "http" do 
          action :start   
        end             

* Puppet

        service { "httpd":
          ensure => running;
        }

## Final Thoughts

There's going to be a learning curve to any config management system, but I have found that
the benefits in being able to audit, repeat, test, and share "desired state" in
code far outweigh any time spent learning the config management tools.
