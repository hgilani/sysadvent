Load balancing solutions in EC2

by [Grig Gheorghiu](http://agiletesting.blogspot.com)

Before Amazon introduced the [Elastic Load Balancing](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) (ELB) service, the only way to do load balancing in EC2 was to use one of the software-based solutions such as [HAProxy](http://haproxy.1wt.eu/) or [Pound](http://www.apsis.ch/pound). 

Having just one EC2 instance running a software-based load balancer would obviously be a single point of failure, so a popular technique was to do DNS Round-Robin and have the domain name corresponding to your Web site point to several IP addresses via separate A records. Each IP address would be an Elastic IP associated to an EC2 instance running the load balancer software. This was still not perfect, because if one of these instances would go down, users pointed to that instance via DNS Round-Robin would still get an error until another instance would be launched.

Another issue that comes up all the time in the context of load balancing is SSL termination. Ideally you would like the load balancer to act as an SSL end-point, in order to offload the SSL computations from your Web servers, and also for easier management of the SSL certificates. HAProxy does not support SSL termination, but Pound does (note that you can still pass SSL traffic through HAProxy by using its TCP mode, you just cannot terminate SSL traffic there.)

In short, if Elastic Load Balancing weren’t available, you could still cobble together a load balancing solution in EC2. There is no reason to ‘roll your own’ anymore however now that you can use the ELB service. Note that HAProxy is still the king of load balancers when it comes to the different algorithms you can use (and to a myriad of other features), so if you want the best of both worlds, you can have an ELB upfront, pointing to one or more EC2 instances running HAProxy, which in turn delegate traffic to your Web server farm.

#### Elastic Load Balancing and the DNS root domain ####

One other issue that comes up all the time in conversations around the ELB service is that an ELB is only available as a CNAME (this is due to the fact that Amazon needs to scale the ELB service in the background depending on the traffic that hits it, so they cannot simply provide an IP address). A CNAME is fine if you want to load balance traffic to www.yourdomain.com, since that name can be mapped to a CNAME. However, the root or apex of your DNS zone, yourdomain.com, can only be mapped to an A record, so for yourdomain.com you could not use an ELB in theory. In practice, however, there are DNS providers that allow you to specify an alias for your root domain (I know [Dynect](http://dyn.com/dns/dynect-managed-dns/) does this, and Amazon’s own [Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/) DNS service).

#### Elastic Load Balancing and SSL ####

The [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) makes it easy to associate an SSL certificate with an ELB instance, at ELB creation time. You do need to add an SSL line to the HTTP protocol table when you create the ELB. Note that even though you terminate the SSL traffic at the ELB, you have a choice of using either unencrypted HTTP traffic or encrypted SSL traffic between the ELB and the Web servers behind it. If you want to offload the SSL processing from your Web servers, you can choose HTTP between the ELB and the Web server instances.

If however you want to associate an existing ELB instance with a different SSL certificate (say for instance you initially associated it with a self-signed SSL cert, and now you want to use a real SSL cert), you can’t do that with the AWS console anymore. You need to use command-line tools. Here’s how.

Before you install the command-line tools, a caveat: you need Java 1.6. If you use Java 1.5 you will most likely get errors such as java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError when trying to run the tools.

1) Install and configure the AWS Elastic Load Balancing command-line tools

- download ElasticLoadBalancing.zip from http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/2536
- unzip ElasticLoadBalancing.zip; this will create a directory named ElasticLoadBalancing-version (latest version at the time of this writing is 1.0.15.1)
- set environment variable AWS_ELB_HOME=/path/to/ElasticLoadBalancing-1.0.15.1 (in .bashrc)
- add $AWS_ELB_HOME/bin to your $PATH (in .bashrc)

2) Install and configure the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAMCli) tools
- download IAMCli.zip from http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/AWS-Identity-and-Access-Management/4143
- unzip IAMCli.zip; this will create a directory named IAMCli-version (latest version at the time of this writing is 1.3.0)
- set environment variable AWS_IAM_HOME=/path/to/IAMCli-1.3.0 (in .bashrc)
- add $AWS_IAM_HOME/bin to your $PATH (in .bashrc)

3) Create AWS credentials file

- create file with following content
AWSAccessKeyId=your_aws_access_key
AWSSecretKey=your_aws_secret_key
- if you named this file aws_credentials, set environment variable AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE=/path/to/aws_credentials (in .bashrc)

4) Get DNS name for ELB instance you want to modify

We will use the ElasticLoadBalancing tool called elb-describe-lbs:

	# elb-describe-lbs
	LOAD_BALANCER  mysite-prod  mysite-prod-2639879155.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com  2011-05-24T22:38:31.690Z
	LOAD_BALANCER  mysite-stage   mysite-stage-714225413.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com    2011-09-16T18:01:16.180Z

In our case, we will modify the ELB instance named mysite-stage.

5) Upload SSL certificate to AWS

I assume you have 3 files:
- the SSL private key in a file called stage.mysite.com.key
- the SSL certificate in a file called stage.mysite.com.crt
- an intermediate certificate from the SSL vendor, in a file called stage.mysite.com.intermediate.crt

We will use the IAMCli tool called iam-servercertupload:

	# iam-servercertupload -b stage.mysite.com.crt -c stage.mysite.com.intermediate.crt -k stage.mysite.com.key -s stage.mysite.com

6) List the SSL certificates you have uploaded to AWS

We will use the IAMCli tool called iam-servercertlistbypath:

	# iam-servercertlistbypath
	arn:aws:iam::YOUR_IAM_ID:server-certificate/stage.mysite.com
	arn:aws:iam::YOUR_IAM_ID:server-certificate/www.mysite.com

7) Associate the ELB instance with the desired SSL certificate

We will use the ElasticLoadBalancing tool called elb-set-lb-listener-ssl-cert:

	# elb-set-lb-listener-ssl-cert mysite-stage --lb-port 443 --cert-id arn:aws:iam::YOUR_IAM_ID:server-certificate/stage.mysite.com
	OK-Setting SSL Certificate

That's it. At this point the SSL certificate for stage.mysite.com will be associated with the ELB instance handling HTTP and SSL traffic for stage.mysite.com. Not rocket science, but not trivial to put together all these bits of information either.
