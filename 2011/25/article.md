# Day 25 - Learning from Other Industries

This post is late because, two days ago (December 24th), I went to the
emergency room with appendicitis. Pretty sweet timing, eh?

After surgery, I was bored and took to observing nursing shift rotations -
hand-offs of patients, documentation maintenance, etc. The entire process
semeed to last about an hour for each shift change. I thought to myself, "Self,
you have never been involved in any operations project, task, or fire hand-off
that went as smoothly." Pretty sad realization.

Further, throughout my hospital stay (emergency room, surgery, and recovery), not
once did I observe any two individuals debating passionately about how best to
treat my illness. Data was available at every decision point. There were
specializations in surgeons for the surgical tasks; nurses to help stabilize,
comfort, and feed me (no small task); and administrative staff to handle the
beaurocracy stuff.

I'm not expecting systems administration to follow exactly what the medical
industry does, just pointing out that it's nice to see a well-orchestrated
system in action. 

And the best part? I never once heard anyone say, "hey! We should try this new
cool thing I heard about."

Further, I never once heard anyone suggesting that we remove my appendix using
node.js and mongodb.

Happy New Year, everyone :)
