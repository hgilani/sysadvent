# Day 25 - Learning from Other Industries

This post is late because, two days ago (December 24th), I went to the
emergency room with appendicitis. Pretty sweet timing, eh?

After surgery, I was bored and took to observing nursing shift rotations -
hand-offs of patients, etc. The entire process semeed to last about an hour for
each shift change. I thought to myself, "Self, you have never been involved in
any operations project, task, or fire hand-off that went as smoothly." Pretty
sad realization.

Further, throughout my hospital stay (emergency room, surgery, and recovery), not
once did I observe any two individuals debating passionately about how best to
treat my illness. There were surgeons for the surgical tasks; nurses to help
stabilize, comfort, and feed me (no small task); and administrative staff to
handle the beaurocracy stuff.

I'm not expecting systems administration to follow exactly what the medical
industry does, just pointing out that it's nice to see a well-orchestrated
system in action. 

And the best part? I never once heard anyone say, "hey! We should try this new
cool thing I heard about," and further suggesting that we remove my appenix
with node.js or mongodb.

Happy New Year, everyone :)
