Packages

* Intro
  * A rough starter guide. Will cover solaris, redhat, and debian.

  * Definition: Package, in general.
    * A named and versioned collection of files.
    * Dependencies
    * Uninstallable

  * Problems?
    * Package and distribution systems are frequently reinvented to solve
      problems but always seem to have a side effect of punishing sysadmins
      by overwhelming you with many tools that do basically the same thing.
    * Upstream likely has different goals and policies than you do, so it
      is in your interest to have local mirrors of upstream packages as well
      as the skills to build your own if upstream is not meeting your needs..
